This mod started with me wanting to recreate a couple of minor features from the old [Gany's](https://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/mapping-and-modding-java-edition/minecraft-mods/1291094-ganys-surface-miscellaneous-overworld-themed) [Mods](https://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/mapping-and-modding-java-edition/minecraft-mods/1291095-ganys-nether-miscellaneous-nether-themed-additions) [collection](https://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/mapping-and-modding-java-edition/minecraft-mods/1291092-ganys-end-miscellaneous-ender-themed-additions). Just to see if I could.

The name pudding was chosen because I wanted to evoke something vanilla-flavoured, as that was the theme I was going for

## Current features:
### Nets

Nets can be crafted which catch bats, squids and glow squids. Then you can release them into the wild or make bat soup.

### Spectre wheat

Spectre wheat is a new nether crop which grows on soul sand. 3 of it make dimensional bread, which has a chance of turning you invisible. Otherwise just a fancier version of wheat.

More features coming soon.... Or not.
